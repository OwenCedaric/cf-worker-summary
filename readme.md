# Article Summarizer Cloudflare Worker

This Cloudflare Worker provides an API endpoint for summarizing web articles using various AI providers. It supports OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cloudflare‘s AI services. The worker can generate summaries in multiple languages and includes features like caching and rate limiting.

## Features

- Summarizes web articles from allowed domains
- Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cloudflare AI)
- **Engineered Architecture**: Based on [Hono](https://hono.dev/) framework, providing standard routing and middleware support
- **Structured Output**: Automatically generates TL;DR, Key Takeaways, and Context
- **High-Performance Caching**: Uses Stale-While-Revalidate mechanism for background updates
- Automatic language detection and multi-language support
- Configurable truncation and custom prompt templates

## Setup

1. Clone this repository or copy the worker script to your Cloudflare Workers project.
2. Set up the required environment variables (see below).
3. Configure the necessary Cloudflare Worker bindings (see below).
4. Deploy the worker to your Cloudflare account.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be set:

### Required
- `ALLOWED_DOMAINS`: Comma-separated list of allowed domains for article URLs (e.g., `fylsen.com,example.com`).

### Optional (AI Configuration)
- `AI_PROVIDER`: The AI service provider to use (`openai`, `anthropic`, `google`, or `cloudflare`). Defaults to `cloudflare` if not set.
- `AI_MODEL`: The specific AI model to use. Defaults to `@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` if not set.
- `AI_API_KEY`: Your API key for the chosen AI provider. Not required for `cloudflare` provider if AI resource is bound.
- `AI_ENDPOINT`: (Optional) Custom endpoint URL for the AI API.
- `PROMPT_TEMPLATE`: (Optional) Custom prompt template for AI requests.

### Other Options
- `CACHE_TTL`: Cache time-to-live in seconds (default 604800 for 7 days).
- `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`: Maximum allowed length of article content to process (default 10000).
- `SUMMARY_MIN_LENGTH`: Minimum length requirements for generated summaries (default 200).

### PROMPT_TEMPLATE

The `PROMPT_TEMPLATE` environment variable allows you to customize the AI prompt instructions. By default, the worker uses a highly optimized **Simplified Chinese instruction set** that guides the model to:
- **Plain Text Output**: Directly output a high-quality summary without any Markdown syntax.
- **Deep Summary**: Extract 2-3 core takeaways into a single, cohesive, and professional paragraph.
- **High Stability**: This format ensures maximum output consistency across all modern LLMs.

If customizing, it's recommended to keep the `${language}` placeholder for multilingual support.

## Cloudflare Worker Bindings

This Worker requires specific Cloudflare Worker bindings to function correctly:

### AI Binding

Used to call Cloudflare AI models directly.
1. Add an `AI` binding in the Cloudflare Worker settings.

### D1 Database Binding

Used for caching generated summaries.

1. Create a new D1 database in the Cloudflare D1 console.
2. Create the required table using the following SQL statement:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS summaries (
     article_url TEXT NOT NULL,
     summary TEXT NOT NULL,
     model TEXT NOT NULL,
     language TEXT NOT NULL,
     created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
     PRIMARY KEY (article_url, language)
   );
   ```

3. In your Worker‘s settings, add a D1 Database binding.
4. Name the binding `DB`.

### AI Worker Binding (MUST, for Cloudflare AI)

You need to set up an AI Worker binding.

1. Ensure that AI capabilities are enabled for your Cloudflare account.
2. In your Worker’s settings, add an AI binding.
3. Name the binding `AI`.

## Deployment

After setting up all necessary environment variables and bindings, you can deploy your Worker:

1. Using the Wrangler CLI:
   ```
   wrangler deploy
   ```
2. Or by uploading your Worker code through the Cloudflare console.

Ensure you have correctly configured all necessary bindings and environment variables before deployment.

## Usage

To use the API, send a GET request to the worker‘s URL with the following query parameters:

- `url`: The URL of the article to summarize
- `lang`: (Optional) The language for the summary. If not provided, it will be determined based on the Accept-Language header or default to English.

Example:

```
https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/summary?url=https://example.com/article&lang=en
```

The API will return a JSON response with the following structure:

```json
{
  "summary": "The generated summary of the article",
  "model": "The AI model used for summarization"
}
```

## Multi-language Support

The worker supports generating summaries in multiple languages. It automatically extracts BCP-47 language codes (e.g., `en-US`, `zh-CN`) from user request parameters or the `Accept-Language` header and passes them directly to the AI model. Modern LLMs are natively capable of understanding these codes and outputting content in the corresponding language.

## Error Handling

The API will return appropriate error messages and status codes for various error conditions, such as:

- Invalid or missing article URL
- Article from a non-allowed domain
- Rate limit exceeded
- Content too long
- AI API errors

## Detailed Features

### Based on Hono Framework

The project has been refactored using the [Hono](https://hono.dev/) framework. This provides:
- **Semantic Routing**: Clear and standard API routing.
- **Improved Middlewares**: Standard CORS and error handling.
- **Modern Standards**: Consistent with Cloudflare Workers' best practices.

### Caching Strategy (SWR)

Summaries are persisted in the D1 database.
- **Stale-While-Revalidate**: If the cache is expired (exceeding `CACHE_TTL`), the worker returns the stale summary immediately while triggering a fresh summary generation in the background.
- This ensures users always get sub-second responses while maintaining eventual consistency of content.

## Content Fetching

The worker defaults to using the [Jina Reader](https://r.jina.ai) service to fetch article content. If this fails, it falls back to directly fetching the HTML and extracting the content.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that the `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` environment variable is properly set to prevent summarization of unauthorized websites.
- Keep your AI API keys secure and do not expose them in the code or public repositories.
- The worker implements CORS headers. Adjust these if you need to restrict access to specific origins.

## Limitations

- The worker can only summarize articles from the allowed domains specified in the `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` environment variable.
- The maximum content length that can be processed is limited by the `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` environment variable.
- The quality and accuracy of summaries depend on the chosen AI provider and model.
- The prompt templates cannot be modified dynamically during runtime. They must be set as environment variables before deploying the worker.
